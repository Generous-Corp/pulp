/// @file audio_doctor.hpp
/// Scenario-driven offline "Audio Doctor" analyzers.
///
/// The Doctor is the top harness layer: it sits ABOVE scenarios and drives a
/// processor through `RenderScenario`, then runs the buffer-level spectrum
/// analyzers in `pulp-audio-analysis` (audio_spectrum.hpp) over the rendered
/// output to answer the "is this DSP behaving correctly?" questions an
/// interactive analyzer answers visually — magnitude/frequency response and
/// harmonic distortion.
///
/// This header owns only the scenario wiring (stimulus synthesis + render);
/// the windowing/FFT/THD/response math lives in `audio_spectrum.hpp` so the
/// `pulp audio validate doctor` CLI can run the same analysis over decoded
/// WAVs without a processor. The result/option structs (`ResponseCurve`,
/// `ThdResult`, `ResponseOptions`, `ThdOptions`, `Window`, ...) come straight
/// from `audio_spectrum.hpp`; this header re-exports them so existing test
/// includes are unchanged.
///
/// Layering (see README.md): signals → metrics → assertions → artifacts →
/// scenarios → contracts, and the Doctor on top. It includes the scenario
/// layer and `audio_spectrum.hpp`; nothing below scenarios may include this
/// header. Target-boundary rule (harness plan §9): the heavy FFT lives in the
/// tool-only `pulp-audio-analysis` lib; this scenario wiring is test-only.
///
/// Test/tool layer only — analysis happens entirely off the audio thread.
