# trace-analysis — the "why is this slow?" investigation harness

Someone who has never opened a profiler types one line — *"why is my plugin
slow to open?"* — and gets a real, plain-English answer with a suggested fix.
This skill is the protocol that makes that happen: you load it, capture or
accept a `.pftrace`, and run a disciplined investigation over it, returning a
narrated root cause and a chain of evidence — never raw SQL. **You are reading
this because a tracing question fired (L1 `explain`) or an expert is driving an
iterative investigation (L2).**

This skill is provider-agnostic by construction: it is a plain `SKILL.md` read
identically by **Claude Code and Codex** from `.agents/skills/`. The whole
"why is this slow?" experience works under any agent because it is a shipped
skill + CLI/MCP surface, not a vendor API.

Its companion is `trace-sql` — the SQL discipline and the Pulp trace-stdlib of
named query primitives. This harness decides *what to ask*; `trace-sql` is
*how to ask it*. Load both for an L2 session.

## The tiers (where this skill sits)

| Tier | Who | Entry | This skill's role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L0** | novice, no agent | `pulp trace slowest-frames`, `--preset dsp-hotspots`/`xruns` | not needed — canned preset → plain table |
| **L1** | novice, one-shot | `pulp trace explain "<q>"` · `pulp_trace_explain` · `/trace "<q>"` | **run this protocol autonomously**, return narrated root cause + evidence + fix |
| **L2** | expert, iterative | `pulp trace query "<sql>"` + this skill + `trace-sql` loaded | drive the full loop by hand on hard/multi-bottleneck cases |

L0 needs no agent. L1 is the headline: you run the whole protocol and hand back
prose. L2 is the same protocol, interactive, for cases the presets cannot crack.

## Capture (if you don't already have a `.pftrace`)

If a capture or query fails for an unclear reason, run the readiness check first
— it tells you, in one shot, whether the inspector is reachable, whether the
host was built with `-DPULP_TRACING=ON`, and whether a `trace_processor` is
available for offline SQL:

```bash
pulp trace doctor            # human report; add --json for {ready_to_capture, ready_to_query, …}
```

`ready_to_capture:false` usually means the inspector is unreachable (start it
with `PULP_TRACE_SERVER=1`) or tracing was compiled out; `ready_to_query:false`
means no `trace_processor` on `$PULP_TRACE_PROCESSOR`/`$PATH` or no captured
trace yet.

```bash
pulp trace start --categories render,gpu,text,js,layout   # pick the categories the question implicates
# ... reproduce (open the editor, sweep the knob, run the offline render) ...
pulp trace stop                                           # → /tmp/pulp-<ts>.pftrace
```

Or accept a `--trace FILE.pftrace` the user hands you. Choose categories from
the question: startup → `render,gpu,text,js,layout`; DSP cost → `dsp,dsp.node`
(offline render); UI hitch → `render,layout,canvas,text,js,gpu` plus a
concurrent `pulp motion record` so the motion `trace_id` joins in.

**Before trusting the capture**, confirm it is not silently empty/truncated
(ring overflow → empty trace): `SELECT DISTINCT category FROM slice`. No rows,
or missing the category you asked for, means re-capture with a larger
`--ring-mb` or a shorter window — not "nothing was slow."

## The investigation protocol

### 1. Keep a chain-of-evidence scratchpad
Write down, as you go: the question → your current hypothesis → the query you
ran → what it showed → the next hypothesis. Every claim in your final answer
must trace back to a specific query result. "Looks slow" is not a finding; "a
`text` span of 540 ms precedes the first frame, from query X" is.

### 2. Hypothesis → query → drill-down loop
Form one hypothesis at a time, query it via the `trace-sql` stdlib (start with
the named views), read the result, refine or discard. Drill from coarse to
fine: category totals (`pulp_layout_vs_paint`) → the fat span → the thread it
ran on → its children → its args. Do not write one giant query; walk down.

### 3. Wall time vs CPU time — the rule that prevents wrong answers
`slice.dur` is **wall-clock** duration. A long slice may be *blocked* (waiting
on a lock, I/O, the GPU, another thread), not *computing*. Before blaming a
long span, check whether it was actually running: join to `thread_state` /
inspect the thread's scheduling for that window. A 600 ms span that was
`Runnable`/blocked 90% of the time is a **waiting** problem (fix the blocker),
not a **compute** problem (optimize the code). Getting this backwards sends the
fix in the wrong direction.

### 4. Follow the blocker across threads
When step 3 says a span was blocked, **follow the blocker**: which thread /
resource held it? The audio block waited on a mutex the UI thread took; the
present waited on a GPU pass; the layout waited on a JS callback. Trace the
wait to its holder on the *other* thread and make *that* the next hypothesis.
The bottleneck is frequently not on the thread that looks slow.

### 5. Exhaustive global verification — do not stop at the first bottleneck
Finding one fat span is not the end. Verify globally: is this the *dominant*
cost, or one of several? Sum the category totals and check the found span's
share. Look for a second offender of comparable size. A fix that removes a
300 ms span from a 2.4 s open still leaves 2.1 s — say so. Report the full
budget, ranked, not just the first thing you noticed.

### 6. p95/p99 discipline — the mean lies
For anything recurring (per-block DSP, per-frame render), the **mean hides the
spike**. A node at 40% mean can eat 60% of the *worst* block. Look at `max_ms`
next to `mean_ms` (the stdlib views expose both), and when the gap is
ambiguous compute the tail (p95/p99) over the raw slices — see `trace-sql`.
"The load meter said 40%; the trace said WHY" is exactly this: the average was
calm, one node's tail was not.

### 7. Consult the domain hints
Match the symptom to a hints file and read it before drawing conclusions — each
grounds the analysis in Pulp's real seams and names the specific traps:

| Symptom | Hints file |
|---|---|
| xruns, per-node DSP cost, deadline miss, "meter calm but one node dominates", jitter/denormals | `references/hints_dsp.md` |
| dropped frames vs vsync budget, layout-vs-paint, `TextShaper::prepare` re-runs, dirty-rect churn, GPU-submit stalls | `references/hints_frame.md` |
| QuickJS bridge dispatch cost, a JS callback invalidating layout | `references/hints_js.md` |
| Dawn submit/present stalls, Graphite record cost, per-pass GPU time | `references/hints_gpu.md` |
| standalone vs plugin-in-DAW vs iOS/iPadOS AUv3 vs Android/Oboe vs Simulator; sample-position args, thread naming, atrace interleave | `references/hints_crossplatform.md` |

### 8. Answer in plain English (L1) — never surface SQL
Return: **root cause** (one or two sentences), **chain of evidence** (numbered,
each tied to what a span/query showed), and a **concrete fix**. Give magnitudes
("~620 ms Dawn/Graphite init, one-time" ), say whether the cost repeats, and
estimate the win. See the worked narrative below.

### Escalating to the user — only at a genuine priority fork
**Default: investigate autonomously.** Follow the blocker, gather evidence, and
verify exhaustively. Resolve every *factual* gap from the trace itself — a
category total, a thread state, a span's args are things you query, not things
you ask. Never stop to ask the user something a query can answer.

**Reach for `AskUserQuestion` only when the direction turns on the user's
priorities, not on data you can gather.** Genuine forks: startup splits
near-evenly across font-shaping *and* shader-compile and only the user knows
which path matters for their use case; or the fix has a fast-approximate branch
and a slower-thorough branch and the tradeoff is theirs to pick. These are
preference forks, not missing facts.

**Form it well:** put the recommended option first and label it recommended,
with a terse pro/con per option. Never use it as a progress checkpoint ("should
I keep going?") — that is exactly the pause to avoid — and never to re-confirm a
decision already made or to ask what a query would answer.

## Worked example — "why is my plugin slow to open?" (the flagship)

This is the safest, most relatable case: bounded, one-shot, **main-thread**,
deterministic — no real-time hazard, works regardless of the DSP story.

```bash
pulp trace start --categories render,gpu,text,js,layout
# ... open the editor ...
pulp trace stop
pulp trace explain "why is my plugin slow to open?"
```

A good answer reads like this:

> **Root cause:** first editor-open spends ~2.4 s, and ~1.9 s of it is one-time
> GPU/text setup on the UI thread before the first frame — none of it cached
> between opens.
>
> **Breakdown:** Dawn device + Graphite context init ~620 ms, Skia font-atlas
> build for the UI typeface ~540 ms, QuickJS eval of the bundled UI script
> ~410 ms, first Yoga layout + `TextShaper::prepare` of every label ~330 ms.
>
> **Chain of evidence:** (1) a `gpu`/`render` span pair brackets the ~620 ms
> device init on the main thread. (2) `text` spans show the font-atlas build
> (~540 ms) preceding the per-label `TextShaper::prepare`. (3) the `js` span for
> script eval is ~410 ms, single-shot. (4) a second open repeats the same spans
> identically — nothing is reused.
>
> **Fix:** warm the Dawn/Graphite context and font atlas once per process (not
> per editor open) and cache the compiled JS module. Re-opens should drop from
> ~2.4 s to well under 500 ms.

The other canonical case is the offline DSP reveal — "CPU pinned but the meter
looks calm — which node?" — run against a deterministic `offline_process()`
render (`examples/trace-demo`) so the answer reproduces exactly. See
`hints_dsp.md` and docs/guides/tracing.md use case 3.

## Agent contract

1. State the question as a measurable target before querying.
2. Verify the capture is non-empty and has the categories you need before
   analyzing. An empty trace is a capture bug, not a "fast" program.
3. Distinguish wall time from CPU time before blaming a long span (step 3).
4. Follow blockers across threads; the slow thread is often not the guilty one.
5. Verify globally — report the ranked budget, not the first bottleneck.
6. Every claim cites a query result. No evidence, no finding.
7. Investigate autonomously; `AskUserQuestion` only at a genuine priority fork,
   never for something a query answers or a progress checkpoint.
8. L1 returns prose (root cause + evidence + fix); never dump SQL at a novice.
