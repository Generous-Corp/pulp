# CI Skill

Validate branches and ship code safely. This skill handles all CI workflows for Pulp across local machines and VMs.

## Prerequisites Check

Before running any CI command, verify the required tooling exists:

```bash
# Required
test -f tools/local-ci/local_ci.py || echo "ERROR: local CI not found — is this a recent checkout?"
command -v gh >/dev/null || echo "ERROR: gh CLI not installed (brew install gh)"

# Optional (for local CI targets)
test -f tools/local-ci/config.json || echo "WARNING: no config.json — copy from config.example.json"
```

If `local_ci.py` doesn't exist, the user likely has an older checkout. Tell them to pull latest main.

## Language Correction

**IMPORTANT**: When a user says "push to main", "merge to main", or "land this", ALWAYS correct them:

> "I won't push directly to main — that bypasses review. Instead, I'll create a PR, run CI on it, and merge it if everything passes. This keeps main safe."

Then proceed with the `ship` workflow below.

## Commands

### `ship [branch]` — The main workflow

Creates a PR, runs CI, and merges on green. This is the default when someone says "ship this" or "push to main".

1. Ensure all changes are committed
2. Push the branch to origin with `-u`
3. Create a PR to main via `gh pr create`
4. Run local CI: `python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run <branch>`
5. If ALL targets pass → `gh pr merge <PR#> --squash --delete-branch`
6. If ANY target fails → report failures, leave PR open
7. Notify when done (terminal bell)

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run [branch]
```

### `run [branch]` — Just validate, no PR

Run local CI on the current branch without creating a PR or merging.

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run [branch]
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run [branch] --smoke
```

For SSH targets, `run` uploads the exact queued SHA as a git bundle before validation, so Ubuntu and Windows do not need that branch tip to be visible on the host ahead of time.
Use `--smoke` for a fast clean install/export preflight when you want early signal before paying for the full test matrix. Smoke runs are explicitly labeled as `validation=smoke`.
If you queue a newer SHA for the same branch, targets, and validation mode, older pending work is superseded automatically.

Useful queue controls:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run [branch] --targets mac
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run [branch] --smoke --targets windows
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py enqueue [branch] --priority low
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py bump <job-id> high
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py logs <job-id> --target windows
```

### `check <PR#|URL|latest>` — Validate an existing PR

Run CI on an existing PR by number, GitHub URL, or "latest".

1. If `latest` → use `gh pr list --limit 1 --json number` to get the most recent PR
2. If URL → extract PR number from the URL
3. Fetch the PR's head branch: `gh pr view <number> --json headRefName`
4. Checkout that branch locally
5. Run local CI: `python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run <branch>` or `python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py check <PR#> --smoke` for a fast preflight
6. Post results as a PR comment via `gh pr comment`

### `list` — Show open PRs

Show open PRs with summaries so the user can pick one to check or merge.

```bash
gh pr list --json number,title,author,headRefName,createdAt,labels --template '{{range .}}#{{.number}} {{.title}} ({{.headRefName}}) by {{.author.login}} {{timeago .createdAt}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'
```

### `status` — Queue, live target state, and VM status

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py status
```

While a job is still running, `status` can show live target state for the active job, for example `mac=pass, ubuntu=pass, windows=running`.

### `logs [job]` — Tail a saved target log

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py logs <job-id> --target windows
```

Use this when a target looks slow or stuck. The logs come from the machine-global CI state directory, so you can inspect a running job without manual SSH.

When you need to reproduce an intermittent failure locally before spending another full CI run, use:

```bash
tools/scripts/repeat-until-fail.sh 100 -- ctest --test-dir build -R "<test name>" --output-on-failure
```

## Active CI Incident Loop

Do not treat a running CI job as something to check later. When a local CI job is active, one agent should own the monitoring loop and one agent or process should work the likely fix path locally as soon as a failure becomes actionable.

Required behavior while a job is active:
- Poll `python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py status` proactively.
- Tail `python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py logs <job-id> --target <name>` as soon as a target fails or looks stuck.
- Send user updates without waiting to be asked when a target changes state, a failure appears, or a rerun is queued.
- If one target has already failed, stop treating the rest of that job as the only source of truth. Start local repro or code inspection immediately when the failure is actionable.
- Once a failure is actionable, parallel work is required unless it would contend with the same host or invalidate the active run. Keep one CI owner watching the hosts and one local loop reproducing or patching the likely issue.
- Do not sit idle waiting for unrelated targets to finish if the first failing target already tells you what to investigate.
- Never rerun a target that already passed on the exact same SHA unless the prior result is untrustworthy or the environment changed.
- If only part of the matrix is stale, rerun only that subset of targets.
- Once the failure surface is isolated, prefer the minimum sufficient proof instead of a symmetric rerun. If macOS and Ubuntu already passed on the current head and only Windows changed or failed, rerun Windows only.
- A direct exact-SHA validation on one target is acceptable merge evidence for that target. Do not invalidate earlier same-SHA passes on other targets just because they came from a different run.
- Use `validation=smoke` before full CI when the risk is install/export/build structure rather than runtime test behavior.
- Treat `all targets on one SHA` as a goal, not a reason to blindly rerun already-green same-SHA targets.

Minimum incident response once a failure is visible:
1. Capture the failing job id, target, SHA, validation mode, and first failing test/build step.
2. Decide whether the failure is infrastructure, environment drift, or a likely code/test issue.
3. If actionable, begin the fix or repro loop immediately instead of waiting for the whole matrix to finish.
4. Queue the narrowest truthful rerun needed after the fix.
5. Close the loop with a short status update that says what failed, what is being tried now, and what still remains.

### `cloud run [branch]` — Trigger GitHub Actions

Trigger cloud CI manually via workflow_dispatch (when cloud CI is needed):

```bash
gh workflow run build.yml --ref <branch>
gh workflow run sanitizers.yml --ref <branch>
gh workflow run validate.yml --ref <branch>
gh workflow run docs-check.yml --ref <branch>
```

### `cloud status` — Check GitHub Actions

```bash
gh run list --limit 5
```

## Configuration

Config is at `tools/local-ci/config.json` (gitignored, per-developer).
Template at `tools/local-ci/config.example.json`.

Key fields:
- `targets.mac.enabled` — run local Mac validation (default: true)
- `targets.ubuntu` — SSH target for Linux validation
- `targets.windows` — SSH target for Windows validation
- `targets.<name>.host` — primary SSH host alias
- `targets.<name>.fallback_host` — optional secondary SSH host alias if the primary is unreachable
- `targets.<name>.utm_fallback` — optional UTM VM to boot only if SSH hosts are unreachable
- `targets.windows.cmake_generator` / `targets.windows.cmake_platform` — optional Windows CMake generator settings; if `cmake_platform` is omitted the runner infers `ARM64` vs `x64` from the remote host
- `targets.windows.cmake_generator_instance` — optional explicit Visual Studio instance path; if omitted the runner prefers a full VS install over `BuildTools` when both exist
- `defaults.priority` — default queue priority for `run` and `enqueue`
- `defaults.ship_priority` — default queue priority for `ship`
- `defaults.check_priority` — default queue priority for `check`
