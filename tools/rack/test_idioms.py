"""The patch idiom library, and the three ways it could quietly stop working.

    python3 test_idioms.py

1. An idiom that cannot FAIL is not a check. `idiom_check --self-test` builds
   each idiom's minimal patch, confirms it passes, then makes each documented
   mistake and requires a rejection that names the right thing.
2. An idiom nobody can ASK FOR is unreachable. Resolution is tested on the
   prompts that actually disappointed, including ones that imply an idiom
   without naming it -- the half that would otherwise never be exercised.
3. A vocabulary that renders and never reaches the model is the DSP side's
   old failure. The guard is tested on an unsubstituted contract, which must
   be rejected, and on a good one, which must not.
