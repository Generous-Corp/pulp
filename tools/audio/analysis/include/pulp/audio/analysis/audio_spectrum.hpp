/// Buffer-level offline spectrum analyzers: magnitude/frequency response and
/// harmonic distortion (THD / THD+N) over already-rendered audio buffers.
///
/// This is the FFT-bearing core of the offline "Audio Doctor". It takes plain
/// `BufferView`s — buffers that have already left the audio thread, whether
/// rendered through a `RenderScenario` (test side) or decoded from a WAV file
/// (the `pulp audio validate doctor` CLI) — and returns the curve/THD data
/// structures the artifact serializers (audio_doctor_artifacts) write to JSON.
///
/// Target-boundary rule: heavy FFT/analyzer code lives ONLY
/// in test/tool targets. This lib (`pulp-audio-analysis`) depends on core/signal
/// for the FFT and is never linked into a runtime/plugin build — a CMake target
/// boundary makes a violation a link error. The scenario-driven entry points
/// that drive a `Processor` stay in `test/support/audio_doctor.hpp` (test-only);
/// they delegate to the buffer-level functions here so there is a single
/// analysis implementation.
///
/// ── Analyzer Determinism Contract (shared by both analyzers) ───────────────
/// Every spectral fact below is deterministic for identical input on a given
/// platform. The per-analyzer specifics (window, length, stimulus, coherence)
/// are stated on each entry point and echoed verbatim into the curve artifact.
/// Both analyzers:
///   * remove DC by subtracting the segment mean before windowing (the response
///     analyzer skips this for an impulse stimulus — see below);
///   * window a single contiguous analysis segment (no overlap-averaging);
///   * report dB relative to a stated reference, so the FFT backend's absolute
///     normalization (vDSP vs the radix-2 fallback differ by a constant scale)
///     cancels — results are backend-stable to the tolerance the tests state;
///   * take all lengths as powers of two (the radix-2 FFT requirement);
///   * require the analysis segment to lie entirely within the supplied
///     buffer(s) — throws `std::invalid_argument` otherwise. Zero-padding a
///     short capture would window a truncated signal, whose edge leaks like
///     any discontinuity and reads as distortion; shrink `fft_length` to fit
///     the capture instead.
///
/// Test/tool layer only — analysis happens entirely off the audio thread.

///   * **No unwrapping is involved.** Group delay is exact per bin and cannot
///     be corrupted by an unwrapping mistake elsewhere in the curve.
///   * **No frequency step to choose.** There is no finite-difference stride
///     trading resolution against noise; the value at each bin is the true
///     derivative of the segment's phase there.
///   * **Exact, not approximate**, for any signal that lies entirely inside
///     the rectangular analysis window. A truncated (still-ringing) IR is the
///     one real error source: the estimator faithfully reports the group delay
///     of the *truncated* signal. Budget `fft_length` so the response has
///     decayed into the noise floor within it.
/// Expected tolerance for a well-contained IR: within ~0.01 samples of truth

/// `group_delay < fft_length / 2` samples (the phase slope is `−τ·2π/N` per
/// bin). Beyond that the phase aliases and unwrapping silently tracks the
/// wrong branch — budget `fft_length` accordingly.
///
/// Unwrapping also cannot recover the branch across a magnitude null, where
/// the true phase steps discontinuously: **`phase_rad` above a deep stopband
/// null carries an unresolved 2πk ambiguity**, and the undefined bins it walks
/// through contribute noise to the accumulated offset. `group_delay_samples`
/// does not inherit this — it never consults the unwrapped phase.
///
/// ── Stopband contract ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/// `defined = false` with NaN phase and group delay. A bin whose reference
/// (input) spectrum is itself negligible is undefined for the same reason.
///
/// That relative gate is backstopped by an absolute one, because the two fail

// and subtracts. That is what makes a −100 dBc claim measurable with margin.
